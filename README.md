# Beef Raylib 3D Game

## Overview
This project is a game engine learning project developed using BeefLang and using Raylib. I am attempting to
get enough functionality into this project so that I can use it for the upcoming Global Game Jam 2026.

Supported platforms are currently Win64 and Wasm32.

### Implemented:
* Simple camera movement
* Forward rendering
* Cascade Shadow Maps
* Bounding Sphere Frustum Culling
* Jolt Physics

### Wanted before jam:
* Basic shape collision detection
* Ray Picking
* Pathfinding using A*
* UI w/ interaction

### Further research:
* Decals
* Fog
* Post processing
* PBR
* Recast/Detour navigation
